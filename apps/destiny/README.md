## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the `PAGE_A_DAY_SERIES` monorepo by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zapeture/PAGE_A_DAY_SERIES
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

After cloning, navigate into the repository directory and install the necessary dependencies. You can use either npm or yarn for this purpose:

- Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- Using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Finally, to start the development server for the sandstone app within the monorepo, execute the following command:

- Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev --workspace apps/destiny
```

- Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev --workspace apps/destiny
```

The development server will start, and you should now be able to access the sandstone locally at the address provided by the server.

Happy coding!
